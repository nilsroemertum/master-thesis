	abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of a large-scale picture archiving and communication system (PACS) in a clinical environment. The system consists of a PACS infrastructure, composed of a PACS controller, a database management system, communication networks, and optical disk archive. It connects to three MR units, four CT scanners, three computed radiography systems, and two laser film digitizers. Seven display stations are on line 24 h/day, 7 days/wk in genitourinary radiology (2K), pediatric radiology in-patient (1K and 2K) and out-patient (2K), neuroradiology (2K), pediatric ICU (1K), coronary care unit (1K), and one laser film printing station. The PACS is integrated with the hospital information system and the radiology information system. The system has been in operation since February 1992. We have integrated this PACS as a clinical component in daily radiology practice. It archives an average of 2.0-gigabyte image data per workday. A 3-mo system performance of various components are tabulated. The deployment of this large-scale PACS signifies a milestone in our PACS research and development effort. Radiologists, fellows, residents, and clinicians use it for case review, conferences, and occasionally for primary diagnosis. With this large-scale PACS in place, it will allow us to investigate the two critical issues raised when PACS research first started 10 yrs ago: system performance and cost effectiveness between a digital-based and a film-based system.}

 abstract = {This paper reviews the components of Orthanc, a free and open-source, highly versatile ecosystem for medical imaging. At the core of the Orthanc ecosystem, the Orthanc server is a lightweight vendor neutral archive that provides PACS managers with a powerful environment to automate and optimize the imaging flows that are very specific to each hospital. The Orthanc server can be extended with plugins that provide solutions for teleradiology, digital pathology, or enterprise-ready databases. It is shown how software developers and research engineers can easily develop external software or Web portals dealing with medical images, with minimal knowledge of the DICOM standard, thanks to the advanced programming interface of the Orthanc server. The paper concludes by introducing the Stone of Orthanc, an innovative toolkit for the cross-platform rendering of medical images.},
