  abstract = {Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) technology is evolving leading to improvements in the PACS functionality. However, the needs and expectations of PACS users are increasing to cope with the rising demands for improving the workflow and enhancing efficiency in healthcare. The aim was to study the limitations in the current generation of PACS and solutions for improving PACS functionality. This was a longitudinal online observational study of the perspectives of PACS professionals accessed through four online discussion groups on PACS using the LinkedIn network. In this exploratory study, the methodology involved a thematic analysis of qualitative data comprising 250 online posts/comments made by 124 unique PACS professionals collected between January 2014 and December 2015. Participants were mostly male (n\,=\,119, 96\%) from the North America (n\,=\,88, 71\%). Key themes on limitations in the current generation of~PACS were image transmission problems, network and hardware issues, difficulties in changing specific settings, issues in hardcoded Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine attributes, and problems in implementing open source PACS. Main themes on solutions for improving PACS functionality were the integration of multisite PACS, multimedia for PACS, web-based PACS, medical image viewer, open source PACS, PACS on mobile phones, vendor neutral archives for PACS, speech recognition and integration in PACS, PACS backup and recovery, and connecting PACS with other hospital systems. Despite ongoing technological developments, the current generation of PACS has limitations that affect PACS functionality leading to unmet needs and requirements of PACS users, which could impact workflow and efficiency in healthcare.},

  abstract = {A large reduction in use of inpatient care combined with the incentives in the Affordable Care Act is leading to significant consolidation in the hospital industry. What was once a set of independent hospitals having arms-length relationships with physicians and clinicians who provide ambulatory care is becoming a small number of locally integrated health systems, generally built around large, prestigious academic medical centers. The typical region in the United States has 3 to 5 consolidated health systems, spanning a wide range of care settings, and a smaller fringe of health care centers outside those systems. Consolidated health systems have advantages and drawbacks. The advantages include the ability to coordinate care across different practitioners and sites of care. Offsetting this is the potential for higher prices resulting from greater market power. Market power increases because it is difficult for insurers to bargain successfully with one of only a few health systems. Antitrust authorities are examining these consolidated systems as they form, but broad conclusions are difficult to draw because typically the creation of a system will generate both benefit and harm and each set of facts will be different. Moreover, the remedies traditionally used (eg, blocking the transaction or requiring that the parties divest assets) by antitrust authorities in cases of net harm are limited. For this reason, local governments may want to introduce new policies that help ensure consumers gain protection in the event of consolidation, such as insurance products that charge consumers more for high-priced clinicians and health care centers, bundling payments to clinicians and health care organizations to eliminate the incentives of big institutions to simply provide more care, and establishing area-specific price or spending targets.},

  abstract = {Purpose The aims of this study were to evaluate an Internet-based and compact disc-based image transfer system and to compare this system with others in the literature, specifically regarding effects on repeat imaging rate, cost, and radiation dose to patients transferred to a level I regional trauma center. Methods Five hundred consecutive trauma patients transferred to a level I trauma center between June 1 and July 15, 2009, were included in the study. Images were transferred from an outside facility to the trauma center using the Internet and compact discs and uploaded to the trauma center's PACS. Radiographic studies and CT scans at the trauma center were classified as outside studies, completion studies, or repeat studies. Repeat rate, costs, and radiation doses of transferred and repeated CT scans were calculated. Results Four hundred ninety-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The patients' average age was 40.5 years, and 70\% were men. The average Injury Severity Score was 14.7. Three hundred eighty-three patients had 852 CT studies and 380 nonextremity radiographs imported into the trauma center's PACS. At the trauma center, 494 completion CT scans and 2,924 radiographic studies were performed on these patients. Sixty-nine repeat CT scans were performed on 55 patients, equalling a 17\% repeat rate. The total value of imported CT studies was \$244,373.69. Repeat imaging totaled \$20,495.95, or \$84.65 per patient with transferred CT studies. Conclusions Using a combination of the Internet and compact discs to transfer images during inter-hospital transfer is associated with much lower repeat rates than those in the literature, suggesting that regional PACS networks may be useful for reducing cost and radiation exposure associated with trauma.},

  abstract = {Background and motivation Digital pathology has been evolving over the last years, proposing significant workflow advantages that have fostered its adoption in professional environments. Patient clinical and image data are readily available in remote data banks that can be consumed efficiently over standard communication technologies. The appearance of new imaging techniques and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms has significantly reduced the burden on medical professionals by speeding up the screening process. Despite these advancements, the usage of digital pathology in professional environments has been slowed down by poor interoperability between services resulting from a lack of standard interfaces and integrative solutions. This work addresses this issue by proposing a cloud-based digital pathology platform built on standard and open interfaces. Methods The work proposes and describes a vendor-neutral platform that provides interfaces for managing digital slides, and medical reports, and integrating digital image analysis services compatible with existing standards. The solution integrates the open-source plugin-based Dicoogle PACS for interoperability and extensibility, which grants the proposed solution great feature customization. Results The solution was developed in collaboration with iPATH research project partners, including the validation by medical pathologists. The result is a pure Web collaborative framework that supports both research and production environments. A total of 566 digital slides from different pathologies were successfully uploaded to the platform. Using the integration interfaces, a mitosis detection algorithm was successfully installed into the platform, and it was trained with 2400 annotations collected from breast carcinoma images. Conclusion Interoperability is a key factor when discussing digital pathology solutions, as it facilitates their integration into existing institutions' information systems. Moreover, it improves data sharing and integration of third-party services such as image analysis services, which have become relevant in today's digital pathology workflow. The proposed solution fully embraces the DICOM standard for digital pathology, presenting an interoperable cloud-based solution that provides great feature customization thanks to its extensible architecture.},

  abstract = {The limitations of the classic PACS (picture archiving and communication system), such as the backward-compatible DICOM network architecture and poor security and maintenance, are well-known. They are challenged by various existing solutions employing cloud-related patterns and services. However, a full-scale cloud-native PACS has not yet been demonstrated. The paper introduces a vendor-neutral cloud PACS architecture. It is divided into two main components: a cloud platform and an access device. The cloud platform is responsible for nearline (long-term) image archive, data flow, and backend management. It operates in multi-tenant mode. The access device is responsible for the local DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) interface and serves as a gateway to cloud services. The cloud PACS was first implemented in an Amazon Web Services environment. It employs a number of general-purpose services designed or adapted for a cloud environment, including Kafka, OpenSearch, and Memcached. Custom services, such as a central PACS node, queue manager, or flow worker, also developed as cloud microservices, bring DICOM support, external integration, and a management layer. The PACS was verified using image traffic from, among others, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and computed radiography (CR) modalities. During the test, the system was reliably storing and accessing image data. In following tests, scaling behavior differences between the monolithic Dcm4chee server and the proposed solution are shown. The growing number of parallel connections did not influence the monolithic server's overall throughput, whereas the performance of cloud PACS noticeably increased. In the final test, different retrieval patterns were evaluated to assess performance under different scenarios. The current production environment stores over 450 TB of image data and handles over 4000 DICOM nodes.},

Although these systems have improved operational efficiency, significant challenges remain in effectively retrieving DICOM images, which are essential for diagnosis and overall patient care. Moreover, issues such as fragmented systems, interoperability barriers, and complex user interfaces can often prevent healthcare professionals from efficiently accessing medical images. Addressing these challenges, the Transversal PACS Browser API is a robust and user-friendly solution designed to enhance the process of querying and retrieving DICOM images. It offers advanced filtering capabilities through a variety of filter options as well as a custom field search, that allows users to easily navigate through large medical image collections with ease. Additionally, the application provides a unified interface for querying and retrieving from multiple PACS stations, addressing the challenges of fragmentation and complexity associated with accessing medical images. Other key features include the ability to pre-view images directly within the application. All of this contributes to the transversal nature of the API, serving not only healthcare providers, but anyone who relies on efficient access to these resources. To validate the performance and usability of the application, comprehensive testing was carried out with stakeholders of the field, the results of which showed general satisfaction, highlighting the API's clean design, ease of use, and effective search capabilities of the API, as well as the usefulness of previewing images within the application.},

  abstract = {Nowadays usage paradigms of medical imaging resources are requesting vendor-neutral archives, accessible through standard interfaces, with multi-repository support. Regional repositories shared by distinct institutions, tele-radiology as a service at cloud, teaching, and research archives are illustrative examples of this new reality. However, traditional production environments have a server archive instance per functional domain where every registered client application has access to all studies. This paper proposes an innovator ownership concept and access control mechanisms that provide a multi-repository environment and integrates well with standard protocols. A secure accounting mechanism for medical imaging repositories was designed and instantiated as an extension of a well-known open-source archive. A new web service layer was implemented to provide a vendor-neutral solution compliant with modern DICOM Web protocols for storage, search, and retrieval of medical imaging data. The concept validation was done through the integration of proposed architecture in an open-source solution. A quantitative assessment was performed for evaluating the impact of the mechanism in the usual DICOM Web operations. This article proposes a secure accounting architecture able to easily convert a standard medical imaging archive server in a multi-repository solution. The proposal validation was done through a set of tests that demonstrated its robustness and usage feasibility in a production environment. The proposed system offers new services, fundamental in a new era of cloud-based operations, with acceptable temporal costs.},

In the download scenario, the ATRs of CR, CT, and MR images increased by 44.3\%, 56.6\%, and 100.9\%, respectively, when using the server cluster, whereas the ATRs increased by 23.0\%, 39.2\%, and 24.9\% in the upload scenario. In the mix scenario, the transmission performance increased by 45.2\% when using eight computer units. The fault tolerance mechanisms of the server cluster maintained the system availability and image integrity. The server cluster can improve the transmission efficiency while maintaining high reliability and continuous availability in a healthcare environment.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, digital pathology and whole-slide imaging (WSI) have been gaining momentum with the proliferation of digital scanners from different manufacturers. The literature reports significant advantages associated with the adoption of digital images in pathology, namely, improvements in diagnostic accuracy and better support for telepathology. Moreover, it also offers new clinical and research applications. However, numerous barriers have been slowing the adoption of WSI, among which the most important are performance issues associated with storage and distribution of huge volumes of data, and lack of interoperability with other hospital information systems, most notably Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) based on the DICOM standard. This article proposes an architecture of a Web Pathology PACS fully compliant with DICOM standard communications and data formats. The solution includes a PACS Archive responsible for storing whole-slide imaging data in DICOM WSI format and offers a communication interface based on the most recent DICOM Web services. The second component is a zero-footprint viewer that runs in any web-browser. It consumes data using the PACS archive standard web services. Moreover, it features a tiling engine especially suited to deal with the WSI image pyramids. These components were designed with special focus on efficiency and usability. The performance of our system was assessed through a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art solutions. The results demonstrate that it is possible to have a very competitive solution based on standard workflows.},

Easy, yet secure and confidential exchange of imaging exams and the associated reports must be a part of the solutions that are implemented. The availability of historical exams is essential in providing a quality interpretation and reducing inappropriate utilization of imaging services. Today, the exchange of imaging exams is most often achieved via a compact disc. We describe the virtues of this solution as well as challenges that have surfaced. Internet- and cloud-based technologies employed for many consumer services can provide a better solution. Vendors are making these solutions available. Standards for Internet-based exchange are emerging. Just as radiology converged on DICOM as a standard to store and view images, we need a common exchange standard. We will review the existing standards and how they are organized into useful workflows through Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise profiles. Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise and standards development processes are discussed. Health care and the domain of radiology must stay current with quickly evolving Internet standards. The successful use of the ``cloud'' will depend on both the technologies and the policies put into place around them, both of which we discuss. The radiology community must lead the way and provide a solution that works for radiologists and clinicians with use of the electronic medical record. We describe features we believe radiologists should consider when adding Internet-based exchange solutions to their practice.},

The development of PACS is still one of the challenging tasks in the computer engineering field, because the giant amounts of digital image data produced in medical diagnostics require the introduction of novel architectures and technologies. This article decribes the key components of PACS. Typical user environments are analysed and the requirements on the performance of the elements of a PACS are defined.

  abstract = {Background The term `remote diagnosis' in telemedicine describes the procedure wherein medical practitioners diagnose patients remotely by using telecommunications technology. With this method, patients can obtain medical care without having to physically visit a hospital, which can be helpful for people who live in distant places or have restricted mobility. When people in the past had health issues, they were usually sent to the hospital, where they received clinical examinations, diagnoses, and treatment at the facility. Thus, hospitals were overcrowded because of the increase in the number of patients or in the death of some very ill patients given that the completion of medical operations required a significant amount of time. Objective This research aims to provide a literature review study and an in-depth analysis to (1) investigate the procedure and roles of remote diagnosis in telemedicine; (2) review the technical tools and technologies used in remote diagnosis; (3) review the diseases diagnosed remotely in telemedicine; (4) compose a crossover taxonomy among diseases, technologies, and telemedicine; (5) present lists of input variables, vital signs, data and output decisions already applied in remote diagnosis; (6) Summarize the performance assessment measures utilized to assess and validate remote diagnosis models; and (7) identify and categorize open research issues while providing recommendations for future advancements in intelligent remote diagnosis within telemedicine systems. Methods A systematic search was conducted using online libraries for articles published from 1 January 2016 to 13 September 2023 in IEEE, PubMed, Science Direct, Springer, and Web of Science. Notably, searches were limited to articles in the English language. The papers examine remote diagnosis in telemedicine, the technologies employed for this function, and the ramifications of diagnosing patients outside hospital settings. Each selected study was synthesized to furnish proof about the implementation of remote diagnostics in telemedicine. Results A new crossover taxonomy between the most important diagnosed diseases and technologies used for this purpose and their relationship with telemedicine tiers is proposed. The functions executed at each tier are elucidated. Additionally, a compilation of diagnostic technologies is provided. Additionally, open research difficulties, advantages of remote diagnosis in telemedicine, and suggestions for future research prospects that require attention are systematically organized and presented. Conclusions This study reviews the role of remote diagnosis in telemedicine, with a focus on key technologies and current approaches. This study highlights research challenges, provides recommendations for future directions, and addresses research gaps and limitations to provide a clear vision of remote diagnosis in telemedicine. This study emphasizes the advantages of existing research and opens the possibility for new directions and smart healthcare solutions.},

Since most imaging modalities have gone directly digital, with continually increasing resolution, medical image processing has to face the challenges arising from large data volumes. In this paper, we discuss Kilo- to Terabyte challenges regarding (i) medical image management and image data mining, (ii) bioimaging, (iii) virtual reality in medical visualizations and (iv) neuroimaging. Due to the increasing amount of data, image processing and visualization algorithms have to be adjusted. Scalable algorithms and advanced parallelization techniques using graphical processing units have been developed. They are summarized in this paper. While such techniques are coping with the Kilo- to Terabyte challenge, the Petabyte level is already looming on the horizon. For this reason, medical image processing remains a vital field of research.},

  abstract = {Background: Validation studies in digital pathology addressed so far diverse aspects of the routine work. We aimed to establish a complete remote digital pathology service. Methods: Altogether 2295 routine cases (8640 slides) were reported in our studies on digital versus microscopic diagnostics, remote reporting, diagnostic time, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) clinics, frozen sections, and diagnostic sessions with residents. The same senior pathologist was involved in all studies. Slides were scanned by ScanScope AT Turbo (Aperio). Digital images were accessed through the laboratory system (LS) on either 14'' laptops or desktop computers with double 23'' displays for the remote and on-site digital reporting. Larger displays were used when available for remote reporting. First diagnosis was either microscopic, digital, or remote digital only (6 months washout period). Both diagnoses were recorded separately and compared. Turnaround was measured from the registration to sign off or scanning to diagnosis. A diagnostic time was measured from the point slides were made available to the point of diagnosis or additional investigations were necessary, recorded independently in minutes/session, and compared. Jabber Video (Cisco) and Lync (Microsoft) were interchangeably used for the secure, video supervision of activities. Mobile phone, broadband, broadband over Wi-Fi, and mobile broadband were tested for internet connections. Nine autopsies were performed remotely involving three staff pathologists, one autopsy technician, and one resident over the secure video link. Remote and on-site pathologists independently interpreted and compared gross findings. Diverse benefits and technical aspects were studied using logs or information recorded in LS. Satisfaction surveys on diverse technical and professional aspects of the studies were conducted. Results: The full concordance between digital and light microscopic diagnosis was 99\% (594/600 cases). A minor discordance, without clinical implications, was 1\% (6/600 cases). The instant upload of digital images was achieved at 20 Mbps. Deference to microscopic slides and rescanning were under 1\%. Average turnaround was shorter and percentage of cases reported up to 3 days higher for remote digital reporting. Larger displays improved the most user experience at magnifications over {\texttimes}20. A digital diagnostic time was shorter than microscopic in 13 sessions. Four sessions with shorter microscopic diagnostic time included more cases requiring extensive use of magnifications over {\texttimes}20. Independent interpretations of gross findings between remote and on-site pathologists yielded full agreement in the remote autopsies. Delays in reporting of frozen sections and FNAC due to scanning were clinically insignificant. Satisfaction levels with diverse technical and/or professional aspects of all studies were high. Conclusions: Complete routine remote digital pathology services are found feasible in hands of experienced staff. The introduction of digital pathology has improved provisions and organizations of our pathology services in histology, cytology, and autopsy including teaching and interdepartmental collaboration.},

Its basic function is to digitize glass slides, but its impact on pathology workflows, reproducibility, dissemination of educational material, expansion of service to underprivileged areas, and intrainstitutional and interinstitutional collaboration exemplifies a significant innovative movement with far-reaching effects. Although the benefits of WSI to pathology practices, academic centers, and research institutions are many, the complexities of implementation remain an obstacle to widespread adoption. In the wake of the first regulatory clearance of WSI for primary diagnosis in the United States, some barriers to adoption have fallen. Nevertheless, implementation of WSI remains a difficult prospect for many institutions, especially those with stakeholders unfamiliar with the technologies necessary to implement a system or who cannot effectively communicate to executive leadership and sponsors the benefits of a technology that may lack clear and immediate reimbursement opportunity.To present an overview of WSI technology---present and future---and to demonstrate several immediate applications of WSI that support pathology practice, medical education, research, and collaboration.Peer-reviewed literature was reviewed by pathologists, scientists, and technologists who have practical knowledge of and experience with WSI.Implementation of WSI is a multifaceted and inherently multidisciplinary endeavor requiring contributions from pathologists, technologists, and executive leadership. Improved understanding of the current challenges to implementation, as well as the benefits and successes of the technology, can help prospective users identify the best path for success.},
