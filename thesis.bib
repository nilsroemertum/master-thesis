  abstract = {Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) technology is evolving leading to improvements in the PACS functionality. However, the needs and expectations of PACS users are increasing to cope with the rising demands for improving the workflow and enhancing efficiency in healthcare. The aim was to study the limitations in the current generation of PACS and solutions for improving PACS functionality. This was a longitudinal online observational study of the perspectives of PACS professionals accessed through four online discussion groups on PACS using the LinkedIn network. In this exploratory study, the methodology involved a thematic analysis of qualitative data comprising 250 online posts/comments made by 124 unique PACS professionals collected between January 2014 and December 2015. Participants were mostly male (n\,=\,119, 96\%) from the North America (n\,=\,88, 71\%). Key themes on limitations in the current generation of~PACS were image transmission problems, network and hardware issues, difficulties in changing specific settings, issues in hardcoded Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine attributes, and problems in implementing open source PACS. Main themes on solutions for improving PACS functionality were the integration of multisite PACS, multimedia for PACS, web-based PACS, medical image viewer, open source PACS, PACS on mobile phones, vendor neutral archives for PACS, speech recognition and integration in PACS, PACS backup and recovery, and connecting PACS with other hospital systems. Despite ongoing technological developments, the current generation of PACS has limitations that affect PACS functionality leading to unmet needs and requirements of PACS users, which could impact workflow and efficiency in healthcare.},

However, changes to laboratory service are imperative if health care professionals expect to survive and thrive in the new business environment.

  abstract = {A large reduction in use of inpatient care combined with the incentives in the Affordable Care Act is leading to significant consolidation in the hospital industry. What was once a set of independent hospitals having arms-length relationships with physicians and clinicians who provide ambulatory care is becoming a small number of locally integrated health systems, generally built around large, prestigious academic medical centers. The typical region in the United States has 3 to 5 consolidated health systems, spanning a wide range of care settings, and a smaller fringe of health care centers outside those systems. Consolidated health systems have advantages and drawbacks. The advantages include the ability to coordinate care across different practitioners and sites of care. Offsetting this is the potential for higher prices resulting from greater market power. Market power increases because it is difficult for insurers to bargain successfully with one of only a few health systems. Antitrust authorities are examining these consolidated systems as they form, but broad conclusions are difficult to draw because typically the creation of a system will generate both benefit and harm and each set of facts will be different. Moreover, the remedies traditionally used (eg, blocking the transaction or requiring that the parties divest assets) by antitrust authorities in cases of net harm are limited. For this reason, local governments may want to introduce new policies that help ensure consumers gain protection in the event of consolidation, such as insurance products that charge consumers more for high-priced clinicians and health care centers, bundling payments to clinicians and health care organizations to eliminate the incentives of big institutions to simply provide more care, and establishing area-specific price or spending targets.},

Although these systems have improved operational efficiency, significant challenges remain in effectively retrieving DICOM images, which are essential for diagnosis and overall patient care. Moreover, issues such as fragmented systems, interoperability barriers, and complex user interfaces can often prevent healthcare professionals from efficiently accessing medical images. Addressing these challenges, the Transversal PACS Browser API is a robust and user-friendly solution designed to enhance the process of querying and retrieving DICOM images. It offers advanced filtering capabilities through a variety of filter options as well as a custom field search, that allows users to easily navigate through large medical image collections with ease. Additionally, the application provides a unified interface for querying and retrieving from multiple PACS stations, addressing the challenges of fragmentation and complexity associated with accessing medical images. Other key features include the ability to pre-view images directly within the application. All of this contributes to the transversal nature of the API, serving not only healthcare providers, but anyone who relies on efficient access to these resources. To validate the performance and usability of the application, comprehensive testing was carried out with stakeholders of the field, the results of which showed general satisfaction, highlighting the API's clean design, ease of use, and effective search capabilities of the API, as well as the usefulness of previewing images within the application.},

  abstract = {Nowadays usage paradigms of medical imaging resources are requesting vendor-neutral archives, accessible through standard interfaces, with multi-repository support. Regional repositories shared by distinct institutions, tele-radiology as a service at cloud, teaching, and research archives are illustrative examples of this new reality. However, traditional production environments have a server archive instance per functional domain where every registered client application has access to all studies. This paper proposes an innovator ownership concept and access control mechanisms that provide a multi-repository environment and integrates well with standard protocols. A secure accounting mechanism for medical imaging repositories was designed and instantiated as an extension of a well-known open-source archive. A new web service layer was implemented to provide a vendor-neutral solution compliant with modern DICOM Web protocols for storage, search, and retrieval of medical imaging data. The concept validation was done through the integration of proposed architecture in an open-source solution. A quantitative assessment was performed for evaluating the impact of the mechanism in the usual DICOM Web operations. This article proposes a secure accounting architecture able to easily convert a standard medical imaging archive server in a multi-repository solution. The proposal validation was done through a set of tests that demonstrated its robustness and usage feasibility in a production environment. The proposed system offers new services, fundamental in a new era of cloud-based operations, with acceptable temporal costs.},

However, as the scale of a hospital's operations increases, the large amount of digital images transferred in the network inevitably decreases system efficiency. In this study, a server cluster consisting of two server nodes was constructed. Network load balancing (NLB), distributed file system (DFS), and structured query language (SQL) duplication services were installed. A total of 1 to 16 workstations were used to transfer computed radiography (CR), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) images simultaneously to simulate the clinical situation. The average transmission rate (ATR) was analyzed between the cluster and noncluster servers. In the download scenario, the ATRs of CR, CT, and MR images increased by 44.3\%, 56.6\%, and 100.9\%, respectively, when using the server cluster, whereas the ATRs increased by 23.0\%, 39.2\%, and 24.9\% in the upload scenario. In the mix scenario, the transmission performance increased by 45.2\% when using eight computer units. The fault tolerance mechanisms of the server cluster maintained the system availability and image integrity. The server cluster can improve the transmission efficiency while maintaining high reliability and continuous availability in a healthcare environment.},

  abstract = {Background The term `remote diagnosis' in telemedicine describes the procedure wherein medical practitioners diagnose patients remotely by using telecommunications technology. With this method, patients can obtain medical care without having to physically visit a hospital, which can be helpful for people who live in distant places or have restricted mobility. When people in the past had health issues, they were usually sent to the hospital, where they received clinical examinations, diagnoses, and treatment at the facility. Thus, hospitals were overcrowded because of the increase in the number of patients or in the death of some very ill patients given that the completion of medical operations required a significant amount of time. Objective This research aims to provide a literature review study and an in-depth analysis to (1) investigate the procedure and roles of remote diagnosis in telemedicine; (2) review the technical tools and technologies used in remote diagnosis; (3) review the diseases diagnosed remotely in telemedicine; (4) compose a crossover taxonomy among diseases, technologies, and telemedicine; (5) present lists of input variables, vital signs, data and output decisions already applied in remote diagnosis; (6) Summarize the performance assessment measures utilized to assess and validate remote diagnosis models; and (7) identify and categorize open research issues while providing recommendations for future advancements in intelligent remote diagnosis within telemedicine systems. Methods A systematic search was conducted using online libraries for articles published from 1 January 2016 to 13 September 2023 in IEEE, PubMed, Science Direct, Springer, and Web of Science. Notably, searches were limited to articles in the English language. The papers examine remote diagnosis in telemedicine, the technologies employed for this function, and the ramifications of diagnosing patients outside hospital settings. Each selected study was synthesized to furnish proof about the implementation of remote diagnostics in telemedicine. Results A new crossover taxonomy between the most important diagnosed diseases and technologies used for this purpose and their relationship with telemedicine tiers is proposed. The functions executed at each tier are elucidated. Additionally, a compilation of diagnostic technologies is provided. Additionally, open research difficulties, advantages of remote diagnosis in telemedicine, and suggestions for future research prospects that require attention are systematically organized and presented. Conclusions This study reviews the role of remote diagnosis in telemedicine, with a focus on key technologies and current approaches. This study highlights research challenges, provides recommendations for future directions, and addresses research gaps and limitations to provide a clear vision of remote diagnosis in telemedicine. This study emphasizes the advantages of existing research and opens the possibility for new directions and smart healthcare solutions.},

Since most imaging modalities have gone directly digital, with continually increasing resolution, medical image processing has to face the challenges arising from large data volumes. In this paper, we discuss Kilo- to Terabyte challenges regarding (i) medical image management and image data mining, (ii) bioimaging, (iii) virtual reality in medical visualizations and (iv) neuroimaging. Due to the increasing amount of data, image processing and visualization algorithms have to be adjusted. Scalable algorithms and advanced parallelization techniques using graphical processing units have been developed. They are summarized in this paper. While such techniques are coping with the Kilo- to Terabyte challenge, the Petabyte level is already looming on the horizon. For this reason, medical image processing remains a vital field of research.},

  abstract = {Background: Validation studies in digital pathology addressed so far diverse aspects of the routine work. We aimed to establish a complete remote digital pathology service. Methods: Altogether 2295 routine cases (8640 slides) were reported in our studies on digital versus microscopic diagnostics, remote reporting, diagnostic time, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) clinics, frozen sections, and diagnostic sessions with residents. The same senior pathologist was involved in all studies. Slides were scanned by ScanScope AT Turbo (Aperio). Digital images were accessed through the laboratory system (LS) on either 14'' laptops or desktop computers with double 23'' displays for the remote and on-site digital reporting. Larger displays were used when available for remote reporting. First diagnosis was either microscopic, digital, or remote digital only (6 months washout period). Both diagnoses were recorded separately and compared. Turnaround was measured from the registration to sign off or scanning to diagnosis. A diagnostic time was measured from the point slides were made available to the point of diagnosis or additional investigations were necessary, recorded independently in minutes/session, and compared. Jabber Video (Cisco) and Lync (Microsoft) were interchangeably used for the secure, video supervision of activities. Mobile phone, broadband, broadband over Wi-Fi, and mobile broadband were tested for internet connections. Nine autopsies were performed remotely involving three staff pathologists, one autopsy technician, and one resident over the secure video link. Remote and on-site pathologists independently interpreted and compared gross findings. Diverse benefits and technical aspects were studied using logs or information recorded in LS. Satisfaction surveys on diverse technical and professional aspects of the studies were conducted. Results: The full concordance between digital and light microscopic diagnosis was 99\% (594/600 cases). A minor discordance, without clinical implications, was 1\% (6/600 cases). The instant upload of digital images was achieved at 20 Mbps. Deference to microscopic slides and rescanning were under 1\%. Average turnaround was shorter and percentage of cases reported up to 3 days higher for remote digital reporting. Larger displays improved the most user experience at magnifications over {\texttimes}20. A digital diagnostic time was shorter than microscopic in 13 sessions. Four sessions with shorter microscopic diagnostic time included more cases requiring extensive use of magnifications over {\texttimes}20. Independent interpretations of gross findings between remote and on-site pathologists yielded full agreement in the remote autopsies. Delays in reporting of frozen sections and FNAC due to scanning were clinically insignificant. Satisfaction levels with diverse technical and/or professional aspects of all studies were high. Conclusions: Complete routine remote digital pathology services are found feasible in hands of experienced staff. The introduction of digital pathology has improved provisions and organizations of our pathology services in histology, cytology, and autopsy including teaching and interdepartmental collaboration.},
