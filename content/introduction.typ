= Introduction
#TODO[
  Introduce the topic of your thesis, e.g. with a little historical overview.
]
#GOAL[
  - Brief history of medical imaging and relevance in diagnostics.
  - Growing importance of remote diagnostics and global collaboration (consolidation of labs, medical service specialization) - Just intro, more extensive in 1.2 Motivaion.
]

== Problem
#TODO[
  Describe the problem that you like to address in your thesis to show the importance of your work. Focus on the negative symptoms of the currently available solution.
]
#GOAL[
  - Current solutions PACS are inflexible and slow when it comes to large-scale medical imaging workflows
    - Long file transfers
    - Lack of interoperability for different scanner vendors
    - Limited options for remote experts (not tailored to specific needs during the workflow)
  - Business side: Lab consoludations, medical service specialization.
  - Technology side: Existing legacy architectures not ready for this new workflow (see first bullet point)
  - Academic gap: No existing architecture tailored for large pathology scan sharing.
]

== Motivation
#TODO[
  Motivate scientifically why solving this problem is necessary. What kind of benefits do we have by solving the problem?
]
#GOAL[
  - Growing global demand for expert diagnostic collaboration.
  - Faster access = faster diagnosis = better patient outcomes.
  - Potential to disrupt current vendor-driven systems with interoperable architecture.
  - Enablement of distributed diagnosis workflows in a globalised and digitalized medical services landscape.
]

== Objectives
#TODO[
  Describe the research goals and/or research questions and how you address them by summarizing what you want to achieve in your thesis, e.g. developing a system and then evaluating it.
]
#GOAL[
  - Analyze Existing Technologies and Architectures.
  - Design a Scalable Architecture for Medical Imaging.
  - Implement a Prototype System.
  - Evaluate the Architecture and Prototype.
]

== Outline
#TODO[
  Describe the outline of your thesis
]
#GOAL[
  - Short overview of thesis chapters.
