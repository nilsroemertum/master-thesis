The thesis starts on April 28, 2024, and ends on October 27, 2024. It is structured into 8 iterations, each lasting 2–4 weeks. Each iteration focuses on a set of measurable and integrated technical deliverables to support the overall objective of developing and validating a scalable architecture for medical imaging.

*Iteration 1: Analyze Existing Technologies and Standards (4 weeks)*
- Research medical imaging standards (e.g. DICOM) and architectures
- Identify limitations in current solutions for sharing large image data
- Deliverable: Technology and requirements report

*Iteration 2: Design the Architecture (2 weeks)*
- Define system requirements for collaboration workflow
- Design a modular architecture for image transfer, storage, and access
- Address compatibility with PACS/LIS and compliance needs (e.g., GDPR)
- Deliverable: Architecture design specification

*Iteration 3: Implement Prototype – Core System (4 weeks)*
- Set up development environment and tech stack
- Implement upload and storage modules for large image data
- Deliverable: Functional prototype for scan upload and retrieval

*Iteration 4: Implement Prototype – Image Sharing Workflow (4 weeks)*
- Implement the end-to-end workflow for second-opinion image sharing
- Ensure workflow consistency across roles (imaging staff, remote experts)
- Deliverable: Integrated image sharing workflow

*Iteration 5: Implement Prototype – Realistic Data Testing and Optimization (3 weeks)*
- Upload and test 20–30 GB pathology scans
- Monitor system performance and reliability
- Troubleshoot edge cases and bottlenecks
- Deliverable: Refined and scalable prototype with test results

*Iteration 6: (Pre-)Validation – Refinement and Review (3 weeks)*
- Ensure integration with test PACS or simulated clinical tools
- Conduct internal review based on stakeholder scenarios
- Deliverable: Validation-ready prototype

*Iteration 7: Validation – Use Case Execution (3 weeks)*
- Validate system through simulated second-opinion scenario
- Measure key metrics (e.g., transfer speed, access latency)
- Deliverable: Use case validation report

*Iteration 8: Validation – Final Evaluation and Wrap-up (3 weeks)*
- Gather stakeholder feedback from imaging technicians and medical experts.
- Validate the architecture’s support for remote diagnostic collaboration.
- Deliverable: Final system evaluation with documented outcomes, including validated architecture for supporting digital pathology workflows.
