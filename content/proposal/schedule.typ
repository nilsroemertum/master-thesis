The thesis starts on April 28, 2024, and ends on October 27, 2024. It is structured into 8 iterations, each lasting 2–4 weeks. Each iteration focuses on a set of measurable and integrated technical deliverables to support the overall objective of developing and validating a scalable architecture for medical imaging.

*Iteration 1: Analyze Existing Technologies and Standards (4 weeks)*
- Supports @analyze.
- Research medical imaging standards (e.g., DICOM) and architectures
- Identify limitations in current solutions for sharing large image data
- Deliverable: Technology and requirements report

*Iteration 2: Design the Architecture (2 weeks)*
- Supports @design.
- Define system requirements for collaboration workflow
- Design a modular architecture for image transfer, storage, and access
- Address compatibility with PACS/LIS and compliance needs (e.g., GDPR)
- Deliverable: Architecture design specification

*Iteration 3: Implement Prototype – Core System (4 weeks)*
- Supports @implement.
- Set up development environment and tech stack
- Implement upload and storage modules for large image data
- Deliverable: Functional prototype for scan upload and retrieval

*Iteration 4: Implement Prototype – Image Sharing Workflow (4 weeks)*
- Supports @implement.
- Implement the end-to-end workflow for second-opinion image sharing
- Ensure workflow consistency across roles (imaging staff, remote experts)
- Deliverable: Integrated image sharing workflow

*Iteration 5: Implement Prototype – Data Testing (3 weeks)*
- Supports @implement.
- Upload and test large pathology scans
- Monitor system performance and reliability
- Deliverable: Refined and scalable prototype

*Iteration 6: Refinement and Early Testing (3 weeks)*
- Supports @implement and @evaluate.
- Conduct first system tests and stakeholder interviews using test data
- Identify functional gaps and usability issues, and apply slight adjustments
- Deliverable: Test-ready prototype

*Iteration 7: Testing and Stakeholder Feedback (3 weeks)*
- Supports @evaluate.
- Test if the system meets the defined technical requirements (e.g., transfer speed, access latency) through simulated second-opinion scenarios
- Test system usability and integration based on stakeholder feedback
- Deliverable: Test report, including system performance and usability

*Iteration 8: Final Testing and Wrap-up (3 weeks)*
- Supports @evaluate.
- Gather final stakeholder feedback from imaging technicians and medical experts
- Perform final tests of the architecture’s ability to support remote diagnostic collaboration
- Analyze feedback, identify areas for improvement, and finalize architecture
- Deliverable: Final system test report and conclusions about the architecture.
