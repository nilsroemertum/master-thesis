Establishing a vendor-neutral, interoperable architecture is pivotal for unlocking enhanced efficiency, collaboration, and patient care.

*Benefits for Imaging Personnel:*
A standardized, vendor-independent architecture streamlines workflows for imaging staff by reducing the complexity associated with proprietary formats. This leads to faster image acquisition and processing, minimizing delays and technical hurdles. Such improvements not only enhance productivity but also contribute to a more satisfying work environment.

*Advantages for Medical Experts and Analysts:*
Interoperable systems facilitate seamless access to imaging data across various platforms and imaging devices, enabling medical professionals to collaborate effectively and make timely, informed decisions. This integration supports the use of advanced analytical tools and fosters innovation in diagnostic practices.

*Improvements for Patients:*
Patients benefit from expedited diagnostic processes and reduced waiting times, leading to quicker treatment initiation. Enhanced data security and privacy measures within interoperable systems also bolster patient trust in digital healthcare solutions.

Implementing such an architecture aligns with the broader goals of modern healthcare systems, promoting cost-effectiveness, scalability, and adaptability. @Lebre.2020 introduced a secure, vendor-neutral imaging architecture that serves as a foundation for this thesis. Additionally, @6684428 proposed a web-based medical image viewer architecture designed to facilitate efficient and accessible visualization of medical images through standard web technologies. Building on their work, this thesis extends the concept to support real-world diagnostic collaboration in medical imaging, with a particular focus on validating the approach in a practical use case scenario.
