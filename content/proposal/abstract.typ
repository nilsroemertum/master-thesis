= Abstract
High-resolution medical imaging poses scientific and technical challenges, particularly in handling large, proprietary data formats under strict security and compliance requirements. Addressing these challenges at the intersection of software engineering, cloud computing, and medical informatics requires scalable, interoperable solutions to support diagnostic collaboration.

This thesis develops a vendor-independent, scalable cloud architecture for sharing large medical imaging data, validated through a digital pathology use case with Synlabâ€™s real-world data. The methodology combines a literature review of existing technologies and standards with the design of an architecture optimized for performance, interoperability, and security.
