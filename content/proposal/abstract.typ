= Abstract
High-resolution medical imaging introduces scientific and technical challenges, particularly around the handling of large, proprietary data formats under strict security and compliance requirements. These challenges lie at the intersection of software engineering, cloud computing, and medical informatics, and call for scalable, interoperable solutions to support diagnostic collaboration.

This thesis investigates architectural principles and best practices for cloud-based sharing of large medical imaging data. Its main contribution is a vendor-independent, scalable architecture designed for real-world application. Synlab, the industry partner, provides practical requirements and imaging data to evaluate the solution in the context of digital pathology and second-opinion workflows.

The methodology involves a literature review of existing technologies and standards, followed by the design of a cloud architecture addressing performance, interoperability, and security. Although the solution is broadly applicable to medical imaging, it is validated through a pathology-specific use case using Synlabâ€™s real-world data.
