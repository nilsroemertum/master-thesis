= Abstract
Researchers and engineers face scientific and technical challenges when handling high-resolution medical imaging, particularly with large, proprietary data formats under strict security and compliance requirements. They must provide scalable, interoperable solutions to support diagnostic collaboration at the intersection of software engineering, cloud computing, and medical informatics.

This thesis develops a vendor-independent, scalable cloud architecture for sharing large medical imaging data. We implement a digital pathology use case with Synlabâ€™s real-world data to test this architecture. The methodology combines a literature review of existing technologies and standards with the design of an architecture optimized for performance, interoperability, and security.
