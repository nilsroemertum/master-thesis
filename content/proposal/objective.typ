= Objective
The objective of this thesis is to design, implement, and evaluate a scalable, interoperable architecture for medical imaging that supports real-world diagnostic collaboration. The project builds upon existing work while extending and evaluating it within a pathology-focused use case. The specific goals of this thesis are:

1. Analyze Existing Technologies and Architectures.
2. Design a Scalable Architecture for Medical Imaging.
3. Implement a Prototype System.
4. Evaluate the Architecture and Prototype.

== Analyze Existing Technologies and Architectures <analyze>
The thesis begins with a structured analysis of current medical imaging infrastructures, with a particular focus on interoperability, security, vendor neutrality, and clinical performance. Core areas of investigation include standards such as DICOM/DICOMweb, relevant open-source platforms, and academic research on cloud-based imaging systems.

In this section, the emphasis will be on examining how existing solutions manage large image file transfers, storage, and remote access. Special attention will be paid to technologies that enable fast and secure transmission of medical images, all while upholding stringent requirements for data privacy and clinical accuracy. The analysis aims to uncover effective design patterns and highlight recurring challenges that could hinder scalability or real-world applicability. These insights will form a foundation for defining the technical requirements and guiding architectural decisions in subsequent phases of the thesis.

== Design a Scalable Architecture for Medical Imaging <design>
A second key objective is to design an architecture that enables timely and secure sharing of high-resolution images within diagnostic workflows, particularly in second-opinion scenarios in digital pathology.

To achieve this, the architecture will incorporate mechanisms for efficient large file transfers while maintaining vendor neutrality and seamless integration with existing clinical systems such as PACS and LIS. The design will focus on scalable storage solutions, robust data exchange protocols, and high usability for both imaging personnel and remote diagnostic specialists. Collaboration across institutions will be a central priority, allowing diverse healthcare environments to interact efficiently despite differences in proprietary systems.

== Implement a Prototype System <implement>
A third key objective is the implementation of a prototype system that simulates a complete diagnostic workflow. This includes the stages of image acquisition, secure transfer, storage, and remote access, leveraging open-source or established technologies such as DICOMweb and secure file-sharing protocols.

Designed to be modular and easily replicable, the system will support adaptation to additional medical use cases beyond pathology. It will be developed with real-world clinical constraints in mind and, where feasible, utilize realistic medical imaging data. The implementation will adhere closely to the architecture outlined in Section @design, acting as a practical proof of concept. Furthermore, this prototype will serve as the basis for the evaluation and testing phases of the thesis.

== Evaluate the Architecture and Prototype <evaluate>
The final objective of this thesis is to evaluate the architecture and prototype in a realistic diagnostic context, with a focus on enabling remote collaboration in digital pathology. This evaluation primarily consists of a technical validation to determine whether the system meets the defined performance and integration requirements.

Key aspects of the technical validation include measuring transfer times or response times, and assessing how well the system integrates with existing clinical workflows. These results will help determine whether the system performs reliably and efficiently when handling large medical imaging data in line with the proposed architecture.

In addition to the technical evaluation, the process may also include an exploratory assessment of usability and practical applicability. Where appropriate, feedback from relevant stakeholders—such as medical professionals—may be gathered to provide early insights into user experience and potential areas for refinement.

Insights gained from this evaluation will not only provide evidence of the prototype’s feasibility within the specific use case but will also allow for more general reflections on the strengths and limitations of the underlying architecture. This broader perspective will support an informed assessment of its adaptability and potential applicability in other remote diagnostic settings.
