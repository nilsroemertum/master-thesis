= Objective
This thesis aims to design, implement, and test a scalable, interoperable architecture for medical imaging that supports real-world diagnostic collaboration. The project builds upon existing work while extending and testing it within a pathology-focused use case. The specific goals of this thesis are:

1. Analyze Existing Technologies and Architectures.
2. Design a Scalable Architecture for Medical Imaging.
3. Implement a Prototype System.
4. Test the Architecture and Prototype.

== Analyze Existing Technologies and Architectures <analyze>
The thesis begins with a structured analysis of current medical imaging infrastructures, with a particular focus on interoperability, security, vendor neutrality, and clinical performance. Core areas of investigation include standards such as DICOM/DICOMweb, relevant open-source platforms, and academic research on cloud-based imaging systems.

We examine how existing solutions handle the transfer, storage, and remote access of large image files. The analysis examines technologies that enable fast and secure transmission of medical images while maintaining strict requirements for data privacy and clinical accuracy. The analysis aims to uncover effective design patterns and highlight recurring challenges that could hinder scalability or real-world applicability. These insights will form a foundation for defining the technical requirements and guiding architectural decisions in subsequent phases of the thesis.

== Design a Scalable Architecture for Medical Imaging <design>
A second key objective is to design an architecture that enables timely and secure sharing of high-resolution images within diagnostic workflows, with a particular focus on second-opinion scenarios in digital pathology, where rapid access to diagnostic-quality scans is crucial for efficient collaboration between attending physicians, image creators, and medical specialists. 

The design integrates mechanisms for efficient large file transfers and maintains vendor neutrality and seamless integration with existing clinical systems such as PACS and LIS. It will focus on scalable storage solutions, robust data exchange protocols, and high usability for both imaging personnel and remote diagnostic specialists. Collaboration across institutions will be a central priority, allowing diverse healthcare environments to interact efficiently despite differences in proprietary systems.

== Implement a Prototype System <implement>
A third key objective is the implementation of a prototype system that simulates a complete diagnostic workflow. This includes the stages of image acquisition, secure transfer, storage, and remote access, leveraging open-source or established technologies such as DICOMweb and secure file-sharing protocols.

We will design the system to be modular and easily replicable, supporting adaptation to additional medical use cases beyond pathology. It will be developed with real-world clinical constraints in mind and, where feasible, utilize realistic medical imaging data. We will implement the system closely following the architecture outlined in @design, providing a practical proof of concept. This prototype forms the foundation for the thesis’s testing phase.


== Test the Architecture and Prototype <evaluate>
The final step of this thesis involves testing the architecture and prototype in a realistic diagnostic context, focusing on remote collaboration in digital pathology. These tests determine whether the system meets the defined performance and integration requirements. We will measure key performance indicators such as transfer times and response times to assess how reliably and efficiently the architecture handles large medical imaging data. The tests will also verify how well the system integrates with existing clinical workflows.

In addition to performance testing, we will explore usability aspects to identify operational issues from the perspective of medical professionals. Feedback from these users will reveal potential areas for improvement and suggest practical adjustments to enhance user experience. The tests will provide insights into the prototype’s feasibility within the specific use case and offer a broader understanding of the architecture’s strengths and limitations. This approach will support an informed assessment of the system’s adaptability and potential for other remote diagnostic scenarios.
