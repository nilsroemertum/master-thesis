#TODO[
  Describe related work regarding your topic and emphasize your (scientific) contribution in contrast to existing approaches / concepts / workflows. Related work is usually current research by others and you defend yourself against the statement: “Why is your thesis relevant? The problem was al- ready solved by XYZ.” If you have multiple related works, use subsections to separate them.
